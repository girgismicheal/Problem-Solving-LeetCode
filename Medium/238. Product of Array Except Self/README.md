## The Algorithm Explanation
> 1. Result list fill it with ones
> 2. Assign the first element of nums to product
> 3. Iterate over the nums list
>       > - Begining from index 1
>       > - Assign the previse product to the current result
>       > - Update it by multiplying with the current element
> 4. Assign the last element of nums to product
> 5. Iterate over the nums list
>       > - Begining from index (last-1)
>       > - Assign the previse product to the current result
>       > - Update it by multiplying with the current element
